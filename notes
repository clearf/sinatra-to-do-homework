Sinatra todo Homework:

I will leverage the work donw in class on the address book.  However everything will be types from scratch and documentd 1 step at at time

Use Phil's psql cheatsheet to create a database "to_dos" in postgres
Add a table "todo" to the new database

Columns include:
id, activity, start_time, end_time, location, contact, contact_phone

for the time columns, I am going to keep it simple for now and use VARCHAR.  I was looking at time as a type.  Not going down that rabbit hole right now!

Table created and 5 rows of data have been inserted
